# Recipe Hunt

The app Recipe Hunt is a tool that provides a handy solution to a widely asked question - What's for Lunch or What's for dinner?
The app provides you with a wide list of ingredients to choose from. You select ingredients currently available in your kitchen and see a  list of recipes that can be prepared using these ingredients. All you have to do is select a tasty recipe, follow the directions and You have prepared a scrumptious meal! Enjoy!

The application is developed using flutter framework. For all food, recipe information, I have used Spoonacular API.

The application is available on Google Play Store [Recipe Hunt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myproject.recipehunt).

Try it. If you like the app, do leave a comment of your thoughts!
